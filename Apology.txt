
Dear Dr. Asani,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to sincerely apologize for the late submission of my assignment CSC312. I understand the importance of meeting deadlines and take full responsibility for my delay.

Unfortunately, unforeseen circumstances hindered my ability to complete the assignment on time. However, I acknowledge that this is not an excuse and that I should have communicated any challenges I was facing beforehand.

I assure you that this delay does not reflect my commitment to the course or my respect for your time and effort.

I have attached the completed assignment and would be grateful if you could accept it despite the lateness. I am willing to accept any penalties or consequences resulting from the delay.

Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding in this matter. I will ensure better time management and communication in the future.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Kayode Tunmise Ayodeji
